         nop                           * some code for this dummy routine

         nop                           * some code for this dummy routine

         BR   R14                       * this returns from the subroutine      
```

The code loads the address of this subroutine into register R15, then saves the subsquent address
for returning in register R14.  Then it branches to the routine in register R15.  When the routine
completes it branches to the address in register 14.
