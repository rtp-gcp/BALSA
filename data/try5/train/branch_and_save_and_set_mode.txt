BRANCH AND SAVE AND SET MODE (BASSM) calls a subroutine, preserving the addressing mode.
The addressing mode is changed to the addressing mode of the subroutine.
The subroutine is expected to return via BRANCH AND SET MODE (BSM) to restore the
addressing mode of the caller


PROMPT

Write some code in BAL Assembly to demonstrate the BASSM instruction.
