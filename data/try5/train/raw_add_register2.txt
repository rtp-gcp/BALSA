RESULT


This is example for the AR instruction in BAL:

```
         AR   R1,R2
```


The AR (Add Register) instruction performs two's compliment binary
addition.  Operand 1 and 2 are registers, R1 and R2 containing fullword
integers.  The fullwords are added and the sum is stored
in register 1.  Register 2 is unchanged.

The instruction sets the condition code as follows:

| condition code     |     meaning               |      test with. |
| :-----------------:|:--------------------------|:----------------|
| 0                  | Result is 0; no overflow  |   BE,JE,BZ,JZ   |
| 1                  | Result is <0; no overflow |   BL,JL,BM,JM   |
| 2                  | Result is >0; no overflow |   BH,JH,BP,JP   |
| 3                  | overflow                  |                 |

As an example, consider the following code:

```
         AR   R5,R9
```



This does the following:


| R5 Before |             | R5 After  |
| :-------- | :----------:| :-------- |
| 00000025  | ----------> | 00000028  |


| R9 Before |             | R9 After  |
| :-------- | :----------:| :-------- |
| 00000003  | ----------> | 00000028  |
