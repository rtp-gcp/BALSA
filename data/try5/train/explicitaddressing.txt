The term explicit addressing refers to a programming practice of coding
base registers, index registers and displacement to specify an address
instead of using symbolic names.  It can also involve coding an 
explicit length.  If possible we would prefer to represent a byte in
memory by a symbolic name rathr by using an explicit address.
We also want to avoid using explict lengths.  Usually this is possible.
For instance, consider the following declaration:


```
XFIELD   DS   CL5
```

While this field does specify a length attribute of five, the symbol
`XFIELD` represents the address of the **first** byte of that field.
This is important because the assembler will convert this symbolic
address to a base/displacement format representing the address
of the **first** byte of the field.  This base/displacement address 
(BDDD in hexadecimal) occupies two bytes in assembled code, as seen
in the SS instruction format.

The explicit format for the MVC Move Copy instruction is shown as:

```
         MVC  D1(L1,B1),D2(B2)
```

* D1 - Operand 1 displacement
* L1 - Operand 1 length
* B1 - Operand 1 base register
* D2 - Operand 2 displacement
* B2 - Operand 2 base register

Consider the following example which uses explicit addressing:

```
         MVC  4(8,12),32(8)
```

* 4 is D1 or displacement/offset1
* 8 is L1 or length
* 12 is B1 or Base register1
* 32 is D2 or displacement/offset2
* 8 is B2 or base register2

Using the explicit format above, we can decipher what the instruction will
do.  First we note it is an MVC instruction which copies 8 bytes since the 
number of bytes is determined by the length of operand 1.  Why didn't we
subtract one and code 4(7,12)?  The **answer** is that the assembler will 
subtract one when the assembled code is assembled into object code.

Where is the source of that data being moved?

The answer is given explcitly as 32(8).  This represents a
32-byte displacement from register 8.  During execution, the effective
address i s computed by adding the contents of base register 8 plus the
32-byte displacement.

EA Effective Address = Contents(base register 8) + 32

During execution, it is imperitive that register 8 contains a "known" 
address (the base address) and the second field is 32 bytes from this
base address.

What is the target address where the data will be copied?

The answer is given explictly as 4(12).  This represents a 4-byte
displacement from register 12.  The effective address is computed to
be the contents of base register 12 plus 4.  The field to receive
the data must be an address which is 4 bytes larger than the execution
time address in register 12.
