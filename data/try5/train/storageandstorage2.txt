# SS2 Storage to Storage Instruction Format

There are two subtypes for Storage to Storage instructions.  The
SS2 format is a variation of the SS1 format that contains two
lengths.


The format is as follows:

| byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3       | byte 4 | byte 5 | byte 6 |
| :------| :------| :------------| :------| :------| :------|
| xx     | L1L2   | B1D1         |  D1D1  | B2D2   | D2D2   |
|        | Length | Dest         |        | Src    |        |
|        |        | Base         |        | Base   |        |
|        |        | Displacement 1 | Displacement 1 | Displacement 2 | Displacement 2 |

* Byte 1 - the op code
* Byte 2 
    - the number of bytes associated with operand 1 (minus 1)
    - the number of bytes associated with operand 2 (minus 1)
    - Each length value is 4 bits wide
* Byte 3 and 4 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 1
* Byte 5 and 6 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 2
