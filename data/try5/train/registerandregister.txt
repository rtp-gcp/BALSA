# RR Register and Register Format
The RR format is used for register and register instructions.


The format is as follows:

| Byte 1  | Byte 2    |
|:------- |:----------|
| xx      | R1R2      |
| Op Code | Registers |

* Byte 1 - the op code
* Byte 2 
    - R1 - the register which is operand 1
    - R2 - the register which is operand 2

An example of this format is the LR Load Register instruction.
The effect of the instruction is to copy the contents of the 
register specified by operand 2 into the register specified by
operand 1.  The following example would cause the contents of
register 12 to be copied into register 3.

```
         LR   R3,R12
```
