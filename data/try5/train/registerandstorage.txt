# RS Register and Storage Format
The RS format is used for register and storage instructions.

There are only a few instructions of this type.  The index
register is replaced by a register reference or a 4-bit mask.
One unusual feature of RS instructions is the use of three
operands.  The explicit coding for this instruction is:
`R1,R3,D2(B2)`


The format is as follows:

| Byte 1  | Byte 2 | Byte 3       | Byte 4       |
|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------------|
| xx      | R1X3   | B2D2         |  D2D2        |
| Op Code | Length | Dest         |              |
|         | Index  | Base         |              |
|         |        | Displacement | Displacement |

* Byte 1 - the op code
* Byte 2 
    - R1 - the register which is operand 1
    - X3 - the index register associated with operand 2
* Byte 3 and 4 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 3

The numbering is funny here.  In this explicit coding, the second
operand is X3 and the third opeand is D2(B2)


An example of this format is the STM Store Multiple instruction.

```
         STM  R14,R12,12(R13)
```

The instruction would generate the following object code:


| byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3 | byte 4 |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 90     | EC     | D0     | 0C     |

* 90 corresponds to STM
* E corresponds to R14 or R1
* C corresponds to R12 or X3
* D correcponds to 13 or B2
* 00C corresponds to 12 or D2
