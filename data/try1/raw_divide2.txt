OPCODE  R1X2   B2D2  D2D2

The Divide (D) instruction performs two's compliment binary
integer division.  

An example of integer division is:  

Y = A / B with remainder R

A is referred to as the dividend
B is referred to as the divisor
Y is referred to as quotient
R is referred to as the remainder

Operand 1 specifies a register pair.  Operand 1
specifies an even register.  The second register is implied as the
next register in the sequence.

For example if Operand 1 is R2, the second register is R3.  This
even:odd register pair forms the dividend.

Operand 2 specifes the name of a fullword in memory containing
the divisor.

After the execution of the divide instruction, the resulting 
quotient is in R1 and the remainder is in R2.   To clarify,
R1 is R8 and R2 is R9 in the example code below.


As an example, consider the following code:

       L     R8,A        PUT THE DIVIDEND IN THE EVEN REGISTER
       SRDA  R8,32       ALGEBRAICALLY SHIFT R8 INTO R9
       D     R8,B        DIVIDE A BY B
       ...
A      DC    F'19'       DIVIDEND 
B      DC    F'5'        DIVISOR 


19/5 -> 3 r=4
