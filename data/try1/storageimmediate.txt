# SI Storage Immediate Format
The SI format is used for storage immediate instructions.

In this format, the second operand, the immediate constant,
resides in the instructions second byte.  This constant
usually specified as a self-defining term.

The format is as follows:

| byte1   | byte2 | byte3        | byte4 |
|---------+-------+--------------+-------+
| Op Code | I2I2  | B1D1         |  D1D1 |
|         | Src   | Dest         |       |
|         | Index | Base         |       |
|         |       | Displacement | Disp. |

* Byte 1 - the op code
* Byte 2 - the immediate constant denoted in operand 2
* Byte 3 and 4 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 1


An example of this format is the CLI Compare Logical 
immediate instruction.

PROMPT

Can you explain the Storage Immediate type instruction format also 
known as SI?
