This constant\n usually specified as a self-defining term.\n \n The format is as follows:\n \n | byte1   | byte2 | byte3        | byte4 |\n |---------+-------+--------------+-------+\n | Op Code | I2I2  | B1D1         |  D1D1 |\n |         | Src   | Dest         |       |\n |         | Index | Base         |       |\n |         |       | Displacement | Disp. |\n \n * Byte 1 - the op code\n * Byte 2 - the immediate constant denoted in operand 2\n * Byte 3 and 4 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 1\n \n \n An example of this format is the CLI Compare Logical \n immediate instruction.\n \n ```\n CLI  CUSTTYPE,C'A'\n ```\n \n \n"
