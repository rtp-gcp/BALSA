# SS2 Storage to Storage Instruction Format

There are two subtypes for Storage to Storage instructions.  The
SS2 format is a variation of the SS1 format that contains two
lengths.


The format is as follows:

| OpCode | byte2 | byte3        | byte4 | byte5 | byte6 |
|--------+-------+--------------+-------+-------+-------|
| xx     | L1L2  | B1D1         |  D1D1 | B2D2  | D2D2  |
|        | Length| Dest         |       | Src   |       |
|        |       | Base         |       | Base  |       |
|        |       | Displacement | Disp. | Disp. | Disp. |

* Byte 1 - the op code
* Byte 2 
    - the number of bytes associated with operand 1 (minus 1)
    - the number of bytes associated with operand 2 (minus 1)
    - Each length value is 4 bits wide
* Byte 3 and 4 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 1
* Byte 5 and 6 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 2

Can you explain the Storage and Storage type two instruction format also known as SS2?
