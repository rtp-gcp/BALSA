This answer is using markdown format.

The column headings are shown as a number ruler and hidden from the 
assembler using comment character in first column as `*`.

```
*        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8

*name starts in column 1
*        operation starts in column 10
*             operands start in column 15
*                              comments start in column 32
*                                                                      continuation starts in column 72
```

* name starts in column 1
* operation starts in 10
* operands start in column 15
* comments which do not start in column 1, must start in column 32
* line continuation characters are placed in column 72
* line continuation characters are typically `x`.  They are used when an instruction spans more than one line.
