RESULT

This answer is using markdown format.

This preformated text block shows the column usage for IBM BAL assembly.
The column headings are shown as a number ruler and hidden from the 
assembler using comment character in first column as `*`.

```
*        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8

*name starts at column 1
*        operation starts at column 10
*             operands start at column 15
*                              comments start at column 32
*                                                                      continuation starts at column 72
```

* name starts at column 1
* operation starts at 10
* operands start at column 15
* comments which do not start in column 1, must start in column 32
* line continuation characters are placed in column 72
* line continuation characters are typically `x`


PROMPT

Provide info on column usage when writing IBM BAL Assembly code.

Your answer should be brief and in markdown format.
