PROMPT

Write some code in IBM BAL Assembly to logical and two fullword registers and store the result in memory with a field name of ANS.  

Your answer should be brief and in markdown format using a code section using this format:

```
put code here
```

Do not include any commentary.  Just produce the code and comments.

Assume the values to logical and are already in registers R7 and R8.

Use `*` to identify a comment and obey column restrictions for the code.

Do not show any subroutine standard entry and exit code.

Show how the field name should be declared.
