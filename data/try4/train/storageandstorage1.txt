# SS1 Storage and Storage Instruction Format

There are two subtypes for Storage to Storage instructions.  The
SS1 format applies to the MVC instruction below



```
         MVC  COSTOUT,COSTIN
```


The format is as follows:

| OpCode | byte2 | byte3        | byte4 | byte5 | byte6 |
| :------| :-----| :------------| :-----| :-----| :-----|
| xx     | L1L1  | B1D1         |  D1D1 | B2D2  | D2D2  |
|        | Length| Dest         |       | Src   |       |
|        |       | Base         |       | Base  |       |
|        |       | Displacement 1 | Displacement 1 | Displacement 2 | Displacement 2 |

* Byte 1 - the op code
* Byte 2 - the number of bytes associated with operand 1 (minus 1)
* Byte 3 and 4 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 1
* Byte 5 and 6 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 2
