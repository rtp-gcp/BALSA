| :------| :------| :------------| :------| :----- | :----- |
| D2     | L1L1   | B1D1         |  D1D1  | B2D2   | D2D2   |
| OpCode | Length | Dest         |        | Src    |        |
|        |        | Base         |        | Base   |        |
|        |        | Displacement 1 | Displacement 1 | Displacement 2 | Displacement 2 |

* Byte 1 - the op code
