RESULT

The ADD HALFWORD instruction algebraically adds the contents of a two-byte field 
in storage to the contents of a register. 

The storage operand is expanded to 32 bits after it is fetched and before it is 
used in the add operation. 
The expansion consists in propagating the leftmost (sign) bit 16 positions to 
the left. 
For example, assume that the contents of storage locations 2000-2001 are to be 
added to register 5.

Initially:

    Register 5 contains 00 00 00 19 = 25 (decimal).
    Storage locations 2000-2001 contain FF FE = -2 (decimal).
    Register 12 contains 00 00 18 00. 
    Register 13 contains 00 00 01 50.

The format of the required instruction is:

Machine Format

| OpCode | R1 | X2 | B2 | D2  | 
|:-------|:---|:---|:---|:----|
| 4A     | 5  | D  | C  | 6B0 |

Assembler Format
Op Code R1,D2(X2,B2)


```
         AH   5,X'6B0'(13,12)
```

After the instruction is executed, register 5 contains 00 00 00 17 = 2310. 
Condition code 2 is set to indicate a result greater than zero.

PROMPT

Write some code in BAL Assembly to add a halfword variable to a register.
