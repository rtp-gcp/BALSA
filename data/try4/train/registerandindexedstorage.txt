# RX Register and Indexed Storage Format
The RX format is used for register and indexed storage instructions.


The format is as follows:

| OpCode | byte2 | byte3        | byte4 |
|:-------|:------|:-------------|:------|
| xx     | L1X2  | B2D2         |  D2D2 |
|        | Length| Dest         |       |
|        | Index | Base         |       |
|        |       | Displacement | Disp. |

* Byte 1 - the op code
* Byte 2 
    - R1 - the register which is operand 1
    - X2 - the index register associated with operand 2
* Byte 3 and 4 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 2


An example of this format is the L Load instruction.
The effect of the instruction is to copy a fullword from memory/storage
in to the register specified by operand 1.
The following example would cause the contents of
memory from the effective address of defined storage `TABLE`
with offset specified by R7. Note in IBM Assembler syntax
the offset is known as displacement.

```
         L    R5,TABLE(R7)
```

Can you explain the Register and Indexed Storage type instruction format also known as RX in BAL Assembly?
