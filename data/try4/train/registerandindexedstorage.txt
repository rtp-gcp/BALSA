# RX Register and Indexed Storage Format
The RX format is used for register and indexed storage instructions.


The format is as follows:

| Byte 1  | Byte 2 | Byte 3       | Byte 4 |
|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| xx      | L1X2   | B2D2         |  D2D2 |
| Op Code | Length | Dest         |       |
|         | Index  | Base         |       |
|         |        | Displacement 2 | Displacement 2 |

* Byte 1 - the op code
* Byte 2 
    - R1 - the register which is operand 1
    - X2 - the index register associated with operand 2
* Byte 3 and 4 - the base/displacement address associated with operand 2


An example of this format is the L Load instruction.
The effect of the instruction is to copy a fullword from memory/storage
in to the register specified by operand 1.
The following example would cause the contents of
memory from the effective address of defined storage `TABLE`
with offset specified by R7. Note in IBM Assembler syntax
the offset is known as displacement.

```
         L    R5,TABLE(R7)
```

Can you explain the Register and Indexed Storage type instruction format also known as RX in BAL Assembly?
