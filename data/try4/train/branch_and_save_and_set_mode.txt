RESULT


BRANCH AND SAVE AND SET MODE (BASM) calls a subroutine, preserving the addressing mode.
The addressing mode is changed to the addressing mode of the subroutine.
The subroutine is expected to return via BRANCH AND SET MODE (BSM) to restore the
addressing mode of the caller
It is primarilly intended to aid calling routines which may have a different addressing mode.

```
         AMODE ANY
         BASM R14,SUBR

SUBR     DS   0H
         AMODE 31

         BSM   R14         
```

PROMPT

Write some code in BAL Assembly to call a subroutine using a different addressing mode and preserve addressing mode
