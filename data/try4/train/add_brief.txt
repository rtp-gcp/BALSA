PROMPT

Write some code in BAL Assembly to add two fullword registers and store the result in memory with a field name of SUM.  

Your answer should be brief and in markdown format using a code section using this format:

```
put code here
```

Do not include any commentary or comments.  Only include code.

Assume the values to add are already in registers R1 and R2.

Obey column restrictions for the code.

Do not show any subroutine standard entry and exit code.

Show how the field name should be declared.
