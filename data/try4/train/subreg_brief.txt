PROMPT

Write some code in BAL Assembly to subtract two fullword registers using integers and store the result in memory with a field name of DIFF.  

Your answer should be brief and in markdown format using a code section using this format:

```
put code here
```

Do not include any commentary.  Just produce the code and comments.

Assume the values to add are already in registers R1 and R2.  

R1 will contain the minuend.

R2 will contain the subtrahend.

Use `*` to identify a comment and obey column restrictions for the code.

Do not show any subroutine standard entry and exit code.

Show how the field name should be declared.
