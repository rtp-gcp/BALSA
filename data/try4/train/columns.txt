This answer is using markdown format.

This preformated text block shows the column usage for IBM BAL assembly.
The column headings are shown as a number ruler and hidden from the
assembler using comment character in first column as `*`.  Assume the first
column on left is number 1 and the columns increase in size while
moving to the right.

As an example here is a code block with commented text describing the
column layout to use for all code blocks.

```
*        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8
*2345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
*label name starts in column 1
*        operation starts in column 10
*             operands start in column 15
*                              comments start in column 32
*                                                                      continuation starts at column 72
```

Here is a concise list of the same rules:

* label name starts in column 1
* operation starts in 10
* operands start in column 15
* comments which are not start in column 1, must start in column 32
* line continuation characters are placed in column 72
* line continuation characters are typically `x`


PROMPT

Provide info on column usage when writing BAL Assembly code.

Your answer should be brief and in markdown format.  If you use preformated text blocks they
should be in this form:

```
put preformated text here
```

Use `*` to identify a comment.
