Memory is organized as a sequence of bytes. Each byte is numbered and the number is called the byte address. 
The first byte has number 0. The second byte has address 1, etc.

This means that for the first word in memory, the first byte is address 0, the second byte is address 1. It 
follows that the last byte in the second word in memory would be address 7.

BAL memory is Big Endian so in terms of byte addresses it would look this to encode the 32 bit
hex number 0x01234567:

```
00: 01
01: 23
02: 45
02: 67
```

How is memory organized in BAL Assembly?
