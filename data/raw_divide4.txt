COMMENTARY

D   R1,D2(X2,B2)

OPCODE  R1X2   B2D2  D2D2

The Divide (D) instruction performs two's compliment binary
integer division.  

An example of integer division is:  

Y = A / B with remainder R

A is referred to as the dividend
B is referred to as the divisor
Y is referred to as quotient
R is referred to as the remainder

Operand 1 specifies a register pair.  Operand 1
specifies an even register.  The second register is implied as the
next register in the sequence.

For example if Operand 1 is R2, the second register is R3.  This
even:odd register pair forms the dividend.

Operand 2 specifes the name of a fullword in memory containing
the divisor.

After the execution of the divide instruction, the resulting 
quotient is in R1 and the remainder is in R2.   To clarify,
R1 is R8 and R2 is R9 in the example code below.


As an example, consider the following code:

       L     R6,=F'-100'  DIVIDEND INITIALLY GOES IN THE EVEN
*                         REGISTER
       SRDA  R6,32        ... AND IS SHIFTED TO THE ODD REGISTER
       D     R6,=F'-8'    ... BEFORE DIVIDING
*                         R6 (REMAINDER) = X'FFFFFFFC' = -4
*                         R7 (QUOTIENT)  = X'0000000C'



-100/-8 -> 12 r=-4


R6 Before               R6 After
Dividend Upper          Remainder
FFFFFFFF -------------> FFFFFFFC

R7 Before               R7 After
Dividend Lower          Quotient
FFFFFF64 -------------> 0000000C

IMM:F             
FFFFFF64 

IMM:F 
FFFFFFF8
