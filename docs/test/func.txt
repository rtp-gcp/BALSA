Writing a Function.

To write a simple function that adds two numbers:

f addNumbers(a, b) {
    result = a + b
    p(result)
}

In this example, f addNumbers(a, b) { ... } defines a new function named addNumbers with two parameters a and b. Inside the function, result is calculated as the sum of a and b, and then it is printed using p(result). The curly braces {} enclose the function body.
