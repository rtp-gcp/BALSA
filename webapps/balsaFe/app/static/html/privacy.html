        What information is collected?
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not have a register page.  You can decide to send an email to me.  If so, I add your email
        to the database which permits your particular email to use the underlying API keys which incur
        cost to me.  Currently, I do not limit the amount of usage, but in the future I could
        modify the code so that particular logins only use the API keys a few time a day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Where information is collected from the webapp?
    </p>

    <p>
        No personal info is collected on the webapp.  When you submit training data, only the text that you supply
        via the webapp training data form is collected.  It does not associate the training data with the permitted
        email address.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Log info might have ip address, but its not retained and not examined.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Why information is collected
    </p>
    <p>
        Its strictly to limit usage.  If I happen to see 100 requests associated by a particular email, I will delete the email
        from the allowed users list.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        How information is collected (including through cookies and other tracking technologies)
    </p>
    <p>
        The session has the email.  In the browser there are three cookies.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Who information is shared with or sold to?
    </p>
    <p>
        The info is not shared or sold.
    </p>



    <p>
        What rights users have over their data?
    </p>
    <p>
        Please send me an email and I will remove your email from the allowed users database.  At some point
        this webapp will be disabled and the emails deleted.
